It took me more than two hours because I reproduced the design in figma first to get the spacing right (I spent like 40 min on figma alone).

## Anything that you're not happy with, or you'd want to change or improve if you had unlimited time to work on this.
I would probably try: 
- Responsive design.
- Animations when the month changes.
- Review accessibility.
- Dark mode.

## What kind of other approaches you might take (tools/technologies/etc) if you were building this app to be "production-ready" for real users.
Not sure if I would change that much. Can it get smaller or faster than this? may be minification can reduce size. May be add things to add better browser support, like PostCSS. I usually use a framework to break things down, keep things simple and improve reusability (React/Vue/Svelte).
